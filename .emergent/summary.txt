The trajectory chronicles the development of Icar assistance, a French towing website, by an AI engineer. Initial work focused on core UI components (Hero, Services, Testimonials, FAQ) using React and TailwindCSS, incorporating glass-morphism and Framer Motion. Subsequent iterations introduced key functionalities like WhatsApp geolocation, an online quote form, and a QR code for reviews. A major theme was continuous visual refinement, including extensive color theme adjustments and numerous image replacements for services, the hero section, and a dynamic slideshow. The AI engineer adeptly handled invalid image URLs by converting content to HTML/CSS. A significant multi-lingual system was implemented for French, English, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, and German, including RTL support for Arabic. Recent tasks involved precise image management for the hero slideshow, logo and phone number enlargement, and the addition of floating sidebar buttons for emergency actions. The process was iterative, with the AI confirming each major implementation step via screenshots and detailed summaries, showcasing a robust build-test-refine cycle.

<product_requirements>
The goal was to create a high-converting, visually stunning French website for Icar assistance, a roadside assistance company. It required a premium design (color contrast, glass-morphism, shadows, rounded corners, gradients, responsive, parallax), a strong typography system, and a limited, atmospheric color palette. Core components included Hero, Services, Testimonials, CTA, FAQ, and Footer. Key features added were: WhatsApp geolocation for precise location sharing; a detailed online quote form with refined fields; a QR code for client reviews; localization of all Île-de-France references to Montpellier; expansion to 13 specialized services; and continuous image updates. Branding involved adapting to a blue sophisticated theme, updating the hero title to Auto Express and slogan to Pour un dépannage sans stress, appelez   !, and darkening grey text. The website also needed a multi-language system for French, English, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, and German, along with floating quick-action buttons and international phone number formatting.
